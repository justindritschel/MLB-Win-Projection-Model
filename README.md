I am building a model to predict wins for the upcoming MLB season that attempts to model how player performance may change and is random from year to year. 
The project uses data from Baseball Reference (https://www.baseball-reference.com/) for individual stats and information, and uses FanGraphs's (https://www.fangraphs.com/)strength of schedule projection for that part of the model.
This model is admittedly primitive, and relies on the accuracy of Baseball Reference's WAR metric, but I think it's a fun way to practice my skills, and look forward to updating the project when the season is over by changing my priors with regards to how performance may change year to year.
This project is nothing that is terribly fancy, but it gives me another opportunity to work with fun data.
I will update this with more information as I continue to flesh out the project.

The Implied Probability and Expected Value script sources in functions to calculate expected values on bets from sportsbooks based on the model's outputs.
