Preparing the data for the 24 season:
```{r}
mets24$Age <- mets24$Age + 1
mets24$WAR23 <- mets24$WAR
```
Let's See:
```{r}
head(mets24)
```
Alright, let's think through the more difficult theoretical stuff now:
Theta will be a parameter that describes how intensely correlated I think WAR is from year to year for players of different age groups (in an attempt to account for aging curves), as well as a year to year flux in performance that is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation one, to account for particularly hot or particularly poor years. This model obviously relies heavily on Baseball Reference's model for WAR and the potential for baked in measurement error thereof. It tries to account for this by adding randomness. Theoretically, after the season is over, I should have a better idea about the correlation of WAR from season to season. Maybe I am greatly overstating the relationship in this model, but I am curious to see its performance.

```{r}
mu_theta_under_27 <- 1.25
sigma_theta_under_27 <- 0.25
mu_theta_27_32 <- 1
sigma_theta_27_32 <- 0.2
mu_theta_33_ <- 0.8
sigma_theta_33_ <- 0.3



mets24 <- mets24 %>%
  mutate(
    theta = if_else(Age < 27, rnorm(n(), mean = mu_theta_under_27, sd = sigma_theta_under_27),
                    if_else(Age >= 27 & Age <= 32, rnorm(n(), mean = mu_theta_27_32, sd = sigma_theta_27_32),
                            if_else(Age >= 33, rnorm(n(), mean = mu_theta_33_, sd = sigma_theta_33_), 0))),
    y2y_flux = rnorm(n(), 0, 1),
    WAR = (WAR23 + y2y_flux) * theta
  )


```

What we are really getting at here is whether I can accurately model year to year fluctuations in war. Probably not, but I think I can get it reasonably right.

Not too bad compared to Fangraph's prediction of 80 wins.

```{r}
sims <- data.frame(simulations)
ggplot(sims, aes(x = simulations)) + geom_histogram(color = 'orange', fill = "blue") + labs(title = "Distribution of 2024 Mets wins after 10000 simulations", x = "Wins")
ggplot(sims, aes(x = simulations)) + geom_density(fill = 'orange', alpha = 0.3)
```

```{r}
sims |>
  summarize(by = mean(simulations > 84))
```
