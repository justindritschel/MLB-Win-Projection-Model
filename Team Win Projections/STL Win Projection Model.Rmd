Building the model (See NYM Model for more relevant information on the model construction):
```{r}

sigma_theta_33_ <- 0.3



cardinals24 <- cardinals24 %>%
  mutate(
    theta = if_else(Age < 27, rnorm(n(), mean = mu_theta_under_27, sd = sigma_theta_under_27),
                    if_else(Age >= 27 & Age <= 32, rnorm(n(), mean = mu_theta_27_32, sd = sigma_theta_27_32),
                            if_else(Age >= 33, rnorm(n(), mean = mu_theta_33_, sd = sigma_theta_33_), 0))),
    y2y_flux = rnorm(n(), 0, 1),
    WAR = (WAR23 + y2y_flux) * theta
  )
```

Running the simulations:

```{r}
simulations_cards <- numeric(10^5)
sims <- 10^5
replacement <- 52 # Baseball Reference's replacement level team should win approximately 52 games
fangraphs_str_of_schedule_proj <- .496
Str_Schedule <- 81 - (162 * fangraphs_str_of_schedule_proj)
for (i in 1:sims) {
  cardinals24 <- cardinals24 %>% #I expect this loop is inefficient
    mutate(
      theta = if_else(Age < 27, rnorm(n(), mean = mu_theta_under_27, sd = sigma_theta_under_27),
                      if_else(Age >= 27 & Age <= 32, rnorm(n(), mean = mu_theta_27_32, sd = sigma_theta_27_32),
                              if_else(Age >= 33, rnorm(n(), mean = mu_theta_33_, sd = sigma_theta_33_), 0))),
      y2y_flux = rnorm(n(), 0, 1),
      WAR = (WAR23 + y2y_flux) * theta
    )
  
  simulations_cards[i] <- sum(cardinals24$WAR) + replacement + Str_Schedule
}
paste("Average number of wins per simulation:", round(mean(simulations_cards)))
paste("Median number of wins per simulation:", round(median(simulations_cards)))
summary(simulations_cards)
```
Visualize the Distribution:
```{r}
sims_cards <- data.frame(simulations_cards)
ggplot(sims_cards, aes(x = simulations_cards)) + geom_histogram(color = 'gold', fill = "red") + labs(title = "Distribution of 2024 Cardinals wins after 100000 simulations", x = "Wins")

ggplot(sims_cards, aes(x = simulations_cards)) + geom_density(fill = 'red', alpha = 0.3)
```


```{r}

  summarize(by = mean(simulations_cards <= 85))
